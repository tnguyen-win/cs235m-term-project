# Known Bugs

1. Saving of text input in state variable is slow, which can cause an intentional error if the state variable is not up-to-date after form submission.

2. Some GitHub Releases throw a "key" error - which is out of my hands to my knowledge, because I don't think I have much control over that particular data.
